    <p class="lead">This is a website designed for the (somewhat) obsessive climber -- i.e., those who want to or already do keep extensive notes on their performance and beta for routes they've tried.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Our platform is designed around allowing users to create beta entries for routes. From that low-level data we're able to also keep track of climber's performance over time, across different crags and areas, and in comparison with other climbers. Our platform enables users to share -- or not -- their notes about specific climbs with their friends. Through this aggregate data we can also provide some interesting metrics about routes themselves, how often they're attempted, flashed, and so on.</p>
